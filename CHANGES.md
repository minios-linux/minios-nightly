    - Implemented full Ventoy support for both storing data in images on the Ventoy partition and using an additional partition for storing changes.
- 2024-12-14 Changed the principle of creating images for storing changes on POSIX-incompatible file systems; now, the space in the image is equal to the free space on the disk.
- 2024-12-14 Modified bootinst.sh to prevent execution without root privileges.
- 2024-12-14 Added the MintStick program to Standard for writing disk images and formatting flash drives.

- 2024-12-16 Added wallpapers for Ultra, Minimum, Home.
- 2024-12-16 Rebuilt under QT5 and added QDiskInfo to the repository.
- 2024-12-16 Replaced HDSentinel with QDiskInfo in Toolbox.
- 2024-12-16 Added memtest to Toolbox and Ultra.

- 2024-12-16 Added dnsmasq-base to all editions.
- 2024-12-16 Added VSCodium to Toolbox.
- 2024-12-22 Moved ntfs3 configuration and polkit configuration from init to systemd.
- 2024-12-22 When building MiniOS, data cleaning is now done in the build_bootstrap step, not build_live.
- 2024-12-22 Improved the ISO image structure, now supports booting from EFI 32-bit.
- 2024-12-22 Changed the init boot logic. Copying the system to RAM occurs before activating persistent changes, allowing the use of saved data after the system is loaded into RAM.
- 2024-12-22 Added new parameters to the kernel parameters and changed the logic of the toram parameter:
    - When the toram parameter is specified, changes are no longer copied to RAM if the perchdir parameter is not specified in the kernel parameters.
    - When the toram or toram=trim parameter is specified, only the data needed to start the system is copied to RAM. Load/noload filters also work for them; excluded modules will not be copied to RAM.
    - If toram=full is specified, all content of the minios folder, except for the modified folder, will be copied, unless the perchdir parameter is specified.
    - Each of these new parameters is independent, and only one of them can be specified.
- 2024-12-22 Changed the logic of running scripts during startup. Now, their execution does not depend on the SCRIPTS variable in minios.conf. If at least one script is in the scripts folder, it will be executed at system startup.
- 2024-12-22 Fixed sb2iso; now the ISO image should be generated correctly. Adapted the code for the new ISO format.
- 2024-12-25 Added mke2fs, e2fsck, lsblk, parted, and partprobe utilities to initrd for working with disks and partitions.
- 2024-12-25 Added the ability to work with saves when writing an ISO image using dd, balenaEtcher, and similar utilities. Now, a partition for storing persistent changes is created automatically on the first launch.
- 2024-12-26 Removed some packages from Minimum to reduce its size.
- 2024-12-26 Added the ability to build with the C locale.
- 2025-01-18 The default initrd compression algorithm now depends on the system compression algorithm.
- 2025-01-18 Removed the -zstd suffix from image and module names since we are not using other compression algorithms.
- 2025-01-18 Removed the xfce-apps module; its functions are now performed by xfce-desktop.
- 2025-01-18 Graphical programs that are not part of any DE have been moved to the apps module.
- 2025-01-18 The xorg module, previously containing Xorg and Blackbox, has been replaced by the gui-base module, which also contains basic GTK2, GTK3, QT5 libraries, icon themes, and other components necessary for all DEs.
- 2025-01-18 Added the ntfs3-dkms package to the repository so that NTFS3 driver support is available in Debian kernels.
- 2025-01-18 Added quirks from the new version of libinput to support new input devices.
- 2025-01-18 Returned the Ultra edition.
- 2025-01-18 Removed gsmartcontrol from Toolbox and Ultra and replaced it with qdiskinfo.
- 2025-01-25 If the system does not support aufs, there will be no menu items responsible for connecting and disconnecting modules.
- 2025-01-25 Removed the ttf-mscorefonts-installer package from Ultra. The usefulness of the package is doubtful compared to the time required for its successful installation in the build.

## v4.1.1
- Removed `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/09-timedate` script, because it does not allow user to set time zone by himself and automatically overrides it to the automatically defined one.
- Fixed a bug in minios-configurator that caused incorrect mapping of fields to variables in the config.
- Fixed the way `minios/minios.conf` files on the drive and `/etc/minios/minios/minios.conf` files are synchronized, because of which locale and other settings are not saved when the drive is in read-only mode.
- Updated the help command `man minios-configurator`.
- The firmware module now uses firmware from bookworm-backports.
- Added the rtw89-dkms driver to the repository.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a created user to be deleted in `puzzle` mode.
- Renamed startup.output and statrup.trace logs to minios-startup.output.log and minios-startup.output.log.
- Renamed boot.output and boot.trace logs to minios-boot.output.log and minios-boot.output.log.
- Reworked iso image file system structure, thanks to which there are no more problems with system booting from BIOS when writing to HDD using sector-by-sector copying (dd, Balena Etcher, ...).
- Added copying of ssh public keys to RAM when `toram=trim`.
- Improved user and group file merging in `puzzle` mode.
- MiniOS kernel updated to 6.1.128.
- Added a check to sb2iso that will prevent the iso from being built if the system is loaded with `toram=trim`.
- Fixed a bug in the builder in the `install_packages` function that caused packages from backports to not be installed when using the `-t` option.
- Added deletion of `/var/cache/mandb` at system build to eliminate mandb cache error when installing packages.
- Added `minios-kernelpack` utility to minios-tools to package kernel modules and create initrd.
- Added a hotkey to open the start menu.
