- 2024-12-22 Improved iso image structure, now supports booting from EFI 32-bit.
- 2024-12-22 Changed init boot logic. Copying of the system to RAM occurs before activation of persistent changes, which allows to use saved data after booting the system to RAM.
- 2024-12-22 Added 3 new parameters to kernel parameters and changed logic of toram parameter:
  - when the toram parameter is specified, changes are now not copied to RAM if the perchdir parameter is not specified in the kernel parameters;
  - when the toram.trim parameter is specified, only data that is necessary to start the system is copied to RAM. Load/noload filters also work for them, excluded modules will not be copied to RAM;
  - when specifying toram.trim.load= and toram.trim.noload= parameters you can specify which folders should be copied to RAM, otherwise both parameters work similarly to toram.trim;
  - each of these new parameters is independent and only one of them can be specified.
